## Statistics

> Q: The following distribution is frequently used in RSS methods: $\beta_j \sim \pi_j\cdot{\cal N}(0,\sigma_j^2) + (1-\pi_j)\cdot\delta_0$. How do you simulate samples from this distribution?

A: This is a mixture of a normal distribution ${\cal N}(0,\sigma_j^2)$
and a point mass at zero $\delta_0$.
To simulate numbers from this mixture distribution,
I first simulate a latent variable $\gamma_j$ from a Bernoulli
distribution which takes the value 1 with probability $\pi_j$.
If $\gamma_j=1$, I draw the value of $\beta_j$ from
the normal distribution ${\cal N}(0,\sigma_j^2)$.
If $\gamma_j=0$, I set $\beta_j=0$.

> Q: How could I reduce the computational time of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) programs provided in [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][]?

A: You can reduce the time by shortening the length of MCMC chains, that is,
setting a smaller value for `Ndraw` in the MCMC programs ([`rss/src`][]).
However, please note that using short MCMC chains may yield
inaccurate inference results for large-scale problems.

> Q: [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][] reported a leave-one-out residual imputation method for model checking. Do you have software for this method?

A: Yes. I write a subroutine [`mvnloo.m`][] for this check.
This leave-one-out residual imputation is a simple
application of multivariate normal distribution.
For more details, please see Equations D.1 and D.2
on page 10 of [Supplement to Zhu and Stephens (2017)][]. 

> Q: How could I reduce the computational time of variational Bayes (VB) programs provided in [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][]?

A: There are two options to reduce the time
of running the VB programs ([`rss/src_vb`][]).
First, you can set a time limit for the VB programs,
that is, setting your own `options.max_walltime` value.
Second, you can use a more relaxed convergence tolerance,
that is, setting your own `options.tolerance` value.
Similar to MCMC, please note that stopping VB iterations early
may yield inaccurate inference results for large-scale problems. 

> Q: [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][] described a simple likelihood ratio calculation as a sanity check for the more sophisticated enrichment analysis based on RSS. Do you have software for this sanity check?

A: Yes. I write a stand-alone script [`ash_lrt_31traits.R`][] for this sanity check.
Please carefully read the instruction in this script.
For more details of this sanity check, please see the caption of
[Supplementary Figure 17][] in [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][].

> Q: [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][] described an integrated framework based on RSS with both enrichment and prioritization components, and we are only interested in the gene prioritization component. How do we perform the gene-level association test using RSS (something like Figure 3 in the paper)? 

A: [Example 5 Part A](example_5a.html) gives a step-by-step illustration of
gene-level association methods built on RSS, with input and output files included.
Since this example is based on a relatively small simulation,
it is highly recommended to run the codes and see how the methods work.

> Q: Can I use the prioritization component of [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][] as a generic gene-level association testing method, assuming that I do not have any gene set information available?

A: Yes. When gene set information is not available,
one can only fit a baseline model ($M_0:\theta=0$)
and obtain corresponding gene-level results.
Indeed Figure 3 Panel A of [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][]
illustrates a possible use scenario like this.  

## Genetics

> Q: RSS uses the shrinkage estimator of LD in [Wen and Stephens (2010)][], the computation of which requires the "scaled population recombination rate" ($\rho_{ij}$). How do I compute $\rho_{ij}$?

A: Details of calculating $\rho_{ij}$ are provided in these two great papers:
[Li and Stephens (2003)][] and [Wen and Stephens (2010)][].
I also write a short [tutorial](recombination.html) to illustrate the calculation of
scaled population recombination rate ($\rho_{ij}$) using HapMap genetic map.

> Q: Most published RSS analyses used phased haplotypes to estimate LD. Can I use unphased genotype data to compute this shrinkage estimator of LD?

A: Yes. You can feed [`get_corr.m`][] an unphased genotype matrix and specify that `isgeno=true`.
There is a "0.5" correction term for genotype data, which comes from a random mating assumption.
Please see Section 2.4 of [Wen and Stephens (2010)][] for more details.

> Q: I know of [Wen and Stephens (2010)][], but I'm not interested in imputation. Do you have software that just computes the banded covariance or LD matrix?

A: Yes. If you have MATLAB available, you can use [`get_corr.m`][].
If you prefer R, you can use [`get_corr.R`][].
I am also working on an R package [`ldshrink`][] that can
produce the banded LD matrix in my (very limited) spare time.

## Data

> Q: If I want to use RSS methods, how should I prepare for the input data?

A: Thanks for your interest in trying RSS methods!
To help you prepare your own data for RSS-based analyses,
I write [a short tutorial about input data formats](input_data.html).
Please note that you need to store your input data in MAT-files if
you plan to use the MATLAB implementation of RSS methods.

> Q: [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][] reported a whole genome analysis of human adult height data based on RSS. I am wondering whether you can share this preprocessed height dataset.

A: Yes. This preprocessed dataset is publicly available at
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1443565>.
and can be referenced in a journal's "Data availability" section
as [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1443565.svg)][zenodo-height2014].
For more information on this dataset, please see [this page](height2014_data.html).

> Q: [Zhu and Stephens (2018)][] reported large-scale enrichment analyses of 4,026 gene sets across 31 complex human traits. Can you share these gene sets?

A: Yes. All 4,026 pre-processed gene sets used in this study
(including 3,913 biological pathways and 113 tissue-based gene sets)
are freely available at [`xiangzhu/rss-gsea`][].
These gene sets can be referenced in a journal's "Data availability" section
as [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/55633948.svg)][zenodo-geneset].
For more information on these gene sets, please see
[this page](https://xiangzhu.github.io/rss-gsea/gene_set.html).

## Software

> Q: RSS is cool, but it is implemented in MATLAB, which is a proprietary programming language. Can RSS methods be made to work with some open source language?

A: To further improve the accessibility of RSS methods,
I am currently working on an R package [`rssr`][] in my (very limited) spare time.
Comments and suggestions are welcome!
