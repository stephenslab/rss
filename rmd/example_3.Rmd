## Overview

This example illustrates the impact of different definitions of standard error (`se`) on RSS.
This example is closely related to Section 2.1 of [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][].

The "simple" version of `se` is the standard error of single-SNP effect estimate,
which is often directly provided in GWAS summary statistics database.
The "rigorous" version of `se` is used in theoretical derivations of RSS
(see Section 2.4 of [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][]),
and it requires some basic calculations based on commonly available summary data.

Specifically, the "simple" version of `se` is given by

$$
\hat{\sigma}_j^2 = (n{\bf X}_j^\prime {\bf X}_j)^{-1} \cdot ({\bf y}-{\bf X}_j\hat{\beta}_j)^\prime ({\bf y}-{\bf X}_j\hat{\beta}_j),
$$

and the "rigorous" version is given by

$$
\hat{s}_j^2=(n{\bf X}_j^\prime {\bf X}_j)^{-1} \cdot ({\bf y}^\prime{\bf y}).
$$

The relation between these two versions is as follows

$$
\hat{s}_j^2=\hat{\sigma}_j^2 + n^{-1}\cdot \hat{\beta}_j^2.
$$

Note that $\hat{s}_j^2\approx\hat{\sigma}_j^2$ when $n$ is large
and/or $\hat{\beta}_j^2$ is small.

In practice, we find these two definitions differ negligibly, mainly because
i) recent GWAS have large sample size ($n$, `Nsnp`)
and small effect sizes ($\hat{\beta}_j$, `betahat`)
(Table 1 of [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][]);
and ii) published summary data are often rounded to two digits to
further limit the possibility of identifiability
(e.g. [GIANT](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files#GIANT_consortium_2012-2015_GWAS_Metadata_is_Available_Here_for_Download)). 

Hence, we speculate that using these two definitions of `se` exchangeably
would not produce severely different results in practice.
Below we verify this speculation by simulations. 

Here we use the same dataset in [Example 1](example_1.html).
Please contact me if you have trouble downloading the dataset.

To reproduce results of Example 3, please read the step-by-step guide below and run [`example3.m`][].
Before running [`example3.m`][], please first install the
[MCMC subroutines of RSS](https://github.com/stephenslab/rss/tree/master/src).
Please find installation instructions [here](setup_mcmc.html).

## Step-by-step illustration

**Step 1**. Define two types of `se`.

We let `se_1` and `se_2` denote the "simple" and "rigorous" version respectively.

```matlab
se_1 = se;                                      % the simple version
se_2 = sqrt((betahat.^2) ./ Nsnp + se.^2);      % the rigorous version 
```

Before running MCMC, we first look at the difference between these two versions of `se`.
Below is the five-number summary<sup>1</sup> of the absolute difference between `se_1` and `se_2`.

```matlab
>> abs_diff = abs(se_1 - se_2);  
>> disp(prctile(log10(abs_diff), 0:25:100)); % require stat toolbox
  -12.0442   -4.6448   -3.9987   -3.4803   -1.3246
```

To make this example as "hard" as possible for RSS,
we do not round `se_1` and `se_2` to 2 significant digits.

**Step 2**. Fit RSS-BVSR using two versions of `se`.

```matlab
[betasam_1, gammasam_1, hsam_1, logpisam_1, Naccept_1] = rss_bvsr(betahat, se_1, R, Nsnp, Ndraw, Nburn, Nthin);
[betasam_2, gammasam_2, hsam_2, logpisam_2, Naccept_2] = rss_bvsr(betahat, se_2, R, Nsnp, Ndraw, Nburn, Nthin);
```

**Step 3**. Compare the posterior output.

We can look at the posterior means of `beta`,
and posterior distributions of `h`, `log(pi)` and PVE
based on `se_1` (blue) and `se_2` (orange).

The PVE estimate (with 95% credible interval) is 0.1932, [0.1166, 0.2869] when using `se_1`,
and it is 0.1896, [0.1162, 0.2765] when using `se_2`.

## More simulations

The simulations in Section 2.3 of [Zhu and Stephens (2017)][]
are essentially "replications" of the example above.
The simulated datasets for Section 2.3 are available as `rss_example1_simulations.tar.gz`<sup>2</sup>.

After applying RSS methods to these simulated data,
we obtain the following results, where
`sigma_hat` corresponds to `se_1`, and `s_hat` corresponds to `se_2`.
